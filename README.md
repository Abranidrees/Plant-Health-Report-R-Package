## Introduction
Increased food consumption because of rapid population expansion has been observed as a worldwide challenge that necessitates novel techniques to achieve sustainable agriculture. Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), one of the 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015, represents food security. The goal is to end hunger, improve food security and nutrition, and encourage sustainable agriculture (FAO, 2017). Remote sensing allows for more accurate, dependable, and timely crop monitoring and planning. The spectrum and multi-temporal resolutions allow for the cost-effective analysis of rapidly changing phenological variations. Using satellite images and vegetation indices (an arithmetic combination of spectral bands relating to vegetation) has shown to be an effective source of accurate data for farmers making informed decisions at various scales. Some of the globally adopted vegetation indices to monitor vegetation indices include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI), and Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE).
